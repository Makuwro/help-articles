# Page customization policy
> Effective on February 12, 2022. Version 1.

We want you to customize your profile to your heart's content. As such, we nearly give you full access to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we show to users. That said, we also want to protect our users, so we made this page customization policy.

# Maximum external CSS size
External CSS per page can be at most 1 MB. This is arbitrary, so we might increase or decrease this limit as we see it being used in action. 

# Submitting JavaScript requests
If you want to add more functionality to your page, you can add JavaScript; but it must be approved by Makuwro staff.

## What is the criteria for approval?
* Your code must be human-readable.

* You may not use any user data.

* You may not use JavaScript that causes major performance issues.

* You may not violate any of our [other policies](/policies).

Basically, we won't judge the quality of your code. Makuwro staff will only test your code to make sure it's safe.

## How long does the review take?
Less than 24 hours after you submit it.

## May I test the JavaScript on my own account before then?
Yes.

## What will happen if my JavaScript is rejected?
* The JavaScript you submitted won't be published.

* We'll send you a message stating why we rejected it.

You may edit your code and resubmit it if you want.

# Elements you may not hide
## The report and block buttons
If you remove the report or block buttons, you must provide an alternative. You can do this by creating a link and pointing it to `?action=report` and `?action=block` respectively. For example, `<a href="?action=block">Block</a>` will work for a block button.
